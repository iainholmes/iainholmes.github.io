# The Rupert Atlas

A self-contained static site under `/rupert/`. It shares nothing with the rest of the repository except Jekyll's copy step: pages have no front matter, and `_tools/` and `_private/` are never published because of their leading underscore.

## One entry point

```
node rupert/_tools/rupert.mjs build     # validate everything, write data/editions/index.json, render every page
node rupert/_tools/rupert.mjs check     # validate only; exits 1 on any error
node rupert/_tools/rupert.mjs test      # edition-selection tests (time zone, Tue/Thu, rollover, DST, ISO weeks)
node rupert/_tools/rupert.mjs audit [--history]
                                        # public-data and privacy audit of everything Jekyll would publish;
                                        # --history also checks every photo blob the branch would push
node rupert/_tools/rupert.mjs photo SOURCE --id ID --provenance archive --alt "…" [options]
                                        # prepare an image (Python helper), then build
```

`build`, `check`, `test` and `audit` need only Node 18+.

`photo` also needs Python 3 and the packages in `_tools/requirements.txt`:

| Package | Why |
|---|---|
| `Pillow`, `numpy` | Always needed |
| `pillow-heif` | For iPhone HEIC originals |
| `rembg[cpu]` | Cuts out the subject for prints. On first use it downloads a ~180 MB model to `~/.rembg`. Without it, pass `--no-cutout`. |

```
python3 -m pip install -r rupert/_tools/requirements.txt
```

Internal helpers, which `rupert.mjs photo` calls for you: `_tools/prep_photos.py` (sizing, metadata stripping, registry) and `_tools/make_print.py` (the field-print treatment).

## Images: three layers

`--kind` is required, because each layer does a different job:

| Kind | What it is | Where it belongs |
|---|---|---|
| `photograph` | The documentary record | Field Log entries, completed adventures, personal memories |
| `print` | The Atlas's signature field print, made from a photograph: cut out, parchment halo, printed background, ochre collar | This Week, edition covers, archive treatments, seasonal moments |
| `plate` | An occasional illustrative or editorial graphic (landscape, water, ridge, sun), imported as-is | Special interludes. Always `--provenance editorial`. |

- **Public copies** in `photos/` carry pixels only: no EXIF, GPS, camera, XMP or ICC data. `check` fails on any JPEG that carries metadata, and on any file in `photos/` that isn't listed in `data/photos.json`.
- **Private context** from the original is kept in `_private/originals.json`: filename, capture time, camera and GPS if present. That file is git-ignored, and `check` fails if `.gitignore` stops covering `_private/`.

Every image has a **provenance**, and the site prints it with the image:

| Provenance | Meaning | Required fields |
|---|---|---|
| `documentary` | Taken at `place_id` on `taken_at`. The caption may name that place. | `place_id`, `taken_at` |
| `archive` | A real photograph whose place is unknown or unrelated to where it's used. It is never captioned as the edition's place. | none |
| `editorial` | Chosen or made for mood. Implies no place. | none |

`check` fails if an edition uses a documentary image from a different place, or if a plate isn't editorial.

Print options:

| Option | Values |
|---|---|
| `--ground` | `lake`, `pine`, `ochre`, `slate`, `rust`, `red`, `parchment` |
| `--threshold` | Ink share of the subject |
| `--background` | `print` or `plain` |
| `--scene` | `none`, `water` or `ridge` |
| `--no-collar` | Turns off the ochre spot colour on Rupert's collar |
| `--tones 3 --mid 0.18` | **Experimental.** Adds a hatched, engraved midtone that keeps faces and coat detail a hard two-tone split can lose. It is the hook for a fuller engraved style later. |

## Atlas

`atlas/` is a register that always works, plus a map the browser adds on top.

- `assets/js/core/atlas.js` is pure: it turns places, editions (and later the Field Log) into statuses, markers and bounds.
- The UI (`assets/js/atlas-view.js`) reaches the map only through `assets/js/map/maplibre-provider.js`.
- Tile hosts, the style and the relief source live in `assets/js/map/style.js`.
- MapLibre GL JS 5.24.0 is vendored in `vendor/`.

Map states use shape as well as colour:

| State | Marker |
|---|---|
| Recommended | Filled ochre circle |
| Walked | Pine circle with a check |
| Planned | Open diamond |
| Register only | Small ring |

Failure drills:

| URL parameter | Simulates |
|---|---|
| `?maptest=notiles` | Tile host failure |
| `?maptest=nowebgl` | No WebGL |
| `?maptest=offline` | Offline |
| `?maptest=nosize` | A map box with no height (the first iPhone RC bug) |
| `?theme=light` or `?theme=dark` | Forces a palette, to compare themes on one device |

The map counts as ready only once it has **drawn**: the box and canvas have a real size, WebGL is alive, and basemap features are on screen. MapLibre's `load` event alone isn't enough. If it loads but can't draw, the page says so (`size`, `blank` or `lost`) instead of leaving an empty box.

A real stall shows a timeout message after 12 seconds. In every case the register stays usable. `?qa=1` adds a diagnostics panel (see `_tools/IPHONE-QA.md`).

## Editions

Editions live in `data/editions/<ISO week>-<tue|thu>.json`, validated against `schema/edition.schema.json`. Tuesday and Thursday are two separate choices for the same weekend.

`condition_level` sets the weather treatment:

- `"adverse"`: storms, dangerous heat, flooding, closures or ice. Shows Field Red plus the word "Warning" and a triangle.
- `"normal"`: everything else. Shows in ink.

### Publishing a new weekend

This path was proved end to end with W41; see `_tools/PUBLISHING-TEST-W41.md`.

1. Write `data/editions/<week>-tue.json`, with `published_at` set to Tuesday 07:00 New York time. Copying the previous week's file is the quickest start. Every `place_id` must already be in `data/places.json`.
2. Add the cover image with `rupert.mjs photo … --kind print|plate`, unless an image already in `data/photos.json` fits.
3. Set `conditions.as_of` to a full timestamp (for example `2026-10-05T15:00:00-04:00`). Refresh the forecast and `headline_condition` on the morning of publication.
4. Run `rupert.mjs build`, `check` and `audit`. This Week, the Archive, the edition page and the Atlas statuses all update from the data.
5. Commit and push. Repeat for Thursday.

The build writes an edition's page as soon as its `status` is `published`, even before its `published_at`. This Week and the Archive wait for the publication time; the page's own URL does not.

## Before merging

- Build and browser rendering use the real clock in America/New_York. No prototype clock override remains.
- Nothing here is private once merged. `noindex` and staying out of the site's navigation are not privacy controls.

## QA records

- `_tools/MAP-TESTS.md`: desktop map tests (passed), tap-target tests, and access-point verification.
- `_tools/IPHONE-QA.md`: real-iPhone checklist and how to serve the branch to a phone over Wi-Fi. Build 2 passed on a real iPhone.
- `_tools/PUBLISHING-TEST-W41.md`: the end-to-end publishing test, and every step that needed a person.
